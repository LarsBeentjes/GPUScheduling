DSlab Server Notification
Dear [FULLNAME],

We have noticed the execution of a job on the [SERVERNAME] server claiming multipe GPU devices.
In order to provide access to the Data Science resources for all students, we ask you to limit the claiming of hardware to one GPU per session.
Below is a small demo of how this can be done: say you want to run "my_program.py" then the following command will claim only GPU device #5 for your job:
$ CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=5 python my_program.py
Use the GPU monitor or the nvidea-smi command to see which devices are available.

If you are using [SERVERNAME] within the context of a specific course, we ask you to make sure you have read the instructions on working with the [SERVERNAME] server provided by the instructors.

We thank you for your assistence.
