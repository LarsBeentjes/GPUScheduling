RuleMaker: Utility for displaying and manipulating the rules, groups and exceptions.

Rules:
Format is as follows:
[EXCEPT/INCLUDE] [GROUP] [TIME] [NUMBER] [IDLETIME] [INTERVAL] [CUSTOM] [ISSUENO]

[EXCEPT/INCLUDE] is written in the rule as EXCEPT or INCLUDE,
and determines whether the rule is an exclusion-type or an inclusion-type.
Note that only EXCEPT is checked for, so technically INCLUDE is 'any word except EXCEPT'.

Group is a list of student numbers in the 'Groups' file under a 'GROUP X' header.
The X = [GROUP]
This is the list of people this rule applies to.
EXCEPT EMPTYGROUP can be used to have the rule apply to everyone.
Note that in case of duplicate groups only the first group will be used.

[TIME] is a threshold for the amount of time that needs to have passed since the program was created.
In seconds.

[NUMBER] is the threshold for the number of GPUs the program is using.
If, for example, 8, then the program needs to use 8 GPUs to violate the rule.

[IDLETIME] is the amount of time the program may idle, in seconds.

[TIME], [NUMBER] and [IDLETIME] can be set to 0 to be effectively irrelevant, 
so rules that use only [TIME], [NUMBER] or [IDLETIME] as criterion can be created.
Note however that they all need to be violated, not just one of them.

[INTERVAL] determines how much time needs to be between violation-emails for violators of this rule.

[CUSTOM] is an easily customizable variable that will be passed to the mailer, also as [CUSTOM].
It can be used to have one template mail where, for example, only the link to the website is changed.

[ISSUENO] determines which standard mail is sent.
