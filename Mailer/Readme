First sentence of standaardmail is the subject.
Standaardmail may only have spaces and newlines. Tabs and multiple spaces become spaces.
[FULLNAME] is replaced by username.
[SERVERNAME] is replaced by the server name.
[CUSTOM] is replaced by a custom word defined by the rule.

Custommails saves custom e-mails in
username customemail
format.

ownmail:
This file keeps the username, password and address of the e-mail server to be used by the mailer in it.
It's in the following format:
GMAIL/UMAIL - Only these are supported. If UMAIL, use a XXXXXXX@umail.leidenuniv.nl e-mail, if GMAIL use a GMAIL. Has to be in all caps.
inlogname ???@gmail.com/XXXXXXX - for gmail, this needs to be the full gmail. For umail, this needs to be just the XXXXXXX in front of the @
fromaddr ???@gmail.com/XXXXXXX@umail.leidenuniv.nl - this needs to be the full e-mail address.
password PASSWORD - simply replace the ALLCAPS PASSWORD with the password.
Note that inlogname/fromaddr/password need to be in the first position on the line, being used as identifier, and all need to be on separate lines.
Examples:

GMAIL
inlogname SETeam10@gmail.com
fromaddr SETeam10@gmail.com
password GPUSchedule1

UMAIL
inlogname s1530186
fromaddr s1530186@umail.leidenuniv.nl
password MYPASSWORD

Mail_Controller:
Applies the rules to processes, and sends a mail with the mailer when rules are violated.

exceptions:
A file full of usernames that are excepted from all rules.

RuleMaker: Utility for displaying and manipulating the rules, groups and exceptions.

Rules:
Format is as follows:
[EXCEPT/INCLUDE] [GROUP] [TIME] [NUMBER] [IDLETIME] [INTERVAL] [CUSTOM] [ISSUENO]

[EXCEPT/INCLUDE] is written in the rule as EXCEPT or INCLUDE,
and determines whether the rule is an exclusion-type or an inclusion-type.
An exclusion-type rule applies the rule to everyone except the group, and an inclusion-type rule applies only to the group.
Note that only EXCEPT is checked for, so technically INCLUDE is 'any word except EXCEPT'.

Group is a list of student numbers in the 'Groups' file under a 'GROUP X' header.
The X = [GROUP]
This is the list of people this rule applies to.
EXCEPT EMPTYGROUP can be used to have the rule apply to everyone.
Note that in case of duplicate groups only the first group will be used.

[TIME] is a threshold for the amount of time that needs to have passed since the program was created.
In seconds.

[NUMBER] is the threshold for the number of GPUs the program is using.
If, for example, 8, then the program needs to use 8 GPUs to violate the rule.

[IDLETIME] is the amount of time the program may idle, in seconds.

[TIME], [NUMBER] and [IDLETIME] can be set to 0 to be effectively irrelevant, 
so rules that use only [TIME], [NUMBER] or [IDLETIME] as criterion can be created.
Note however that they all need to be violated, not just one of them.

[INTERVAL] determines how much time needs to be between violation-emails for violators of this rule.

[CUSTOM] is an easily customizable variable that will be passed to the mailer, also as [CUSTOM].
It can be used to have one template mail where, for example, only the link to the website is changed.

[ISSUENO] determines which standard mail is sent.
